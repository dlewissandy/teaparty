# TeaParty Research Library

Master catalog of peer-reviewed and authoritative research informing TeaParty design decisions.

Research is organized by topic file. Each entry includes: title, authors/year, tags, and a one-line summary.

See [learning-system.md](../conceptual-design/learning-system.md) for the conceptual design of TeaParty's learning system, which builds on the research foundations in this index.

## Scope and Research Positioning

This bibliography covers five areas that directly inform TeaParty's design: cognitive architectures for LLM agents, memory management and retrieval, multi-agent coordination, human-AI collaboration and oversight, and production deployment patterns. It also includes implementation-level references for the specific libraries and frameworks used in the POC. The collection spans foundational academic work (2022–2024) and active 2025–2026 research, reflecting the rapid development of the field. For TeaParty's positioning relative to this body of work — what it builds on and what it adds — see the Research Positioning section in [docs/index.md](../index.md).

Full four-scope hierarchy (managed, project, local, user). | `claude-code-memory-system.md` §1-3 |
| Claude Code Subagent Persistent Memory | Anthropic, 2026 | `#memory` `#multi-agent` `#production` `#teaparty-direct` | `memory: user/project/local` frontmatter gives each subagent its own MEMORY.md with same 200-line injection rule; identical mechanics to main session memory. | `claude-code-memory-system.md` §3 |
| OpenClaw Memory Architecture | Steinberger et al., 2025-2026 | `#memory` `#retrieval` `#openclaw` `#production` | Hybrid sqlite-vec + FTS5 retrieval over chunked Markdown; selective injection vs. Claude Code's flat injection; open-sourced as memsearch by Zilliz. | `claude-code-memory-system.md` §5 |

## TUI Framework — Textual Widget Events

| Title | Authors/Org, Year | Tags | One-line Summary | Source |
|-------|------------------|------|-----------------|--------|
| Textual ListView.Highlighted Event | Textualize docs, 2024-2025 | `#tui` `#ui-events` `#textual` `#widget` | Fires on arrow key navigation; `event.item` is the ListItem widget; no built-in data payload; use parallel index list or ListItem subclass. | `textual-tui-selection-widgets.md` §1 |
| Textual OptionList.OptionHighlighted Event | Textualize docs, 2024-2025 | `#tui` `#ui-events` `#textual` `#widget` | Fires on arrow keys; `event.option_id` gives the string key set at Option construction — cleanest data-attachment pattern of the three main list widgets. | `textual-tui-selection-widgets.md` §2 |
| Textual Tree.NodeHighlighted Event | Textualize docs, 2024-2025 | `#tui` `#ui-events` `#textual` `#widget` | Fires on arrow keys; `event.node.data` carries arbitrary typed payload set at node creation — most ergonomic for structured data. | `textual-tui-selection-widgets.md` §3 |
| Textual SelectionList.SelectionHighlighted Event | Textualize docs, 2024-2025 | `#tui` `#ui-events` `#textual` `#widget` | Designed for multi-select checkbox lists; wrong widget for single-selection panel-update patterns. | `textual-tui-selection-widgets.md` §4 |
| Textual prevent() Context Manager | Textualize docs, 2024-2025 | `#tui` `#ui-events` `#textual` | Universal gate for suppressing spurious events during programmatic widget rebuilds; canonical solution for clear/repopulate refresh patterns. | `textual-tui-selection-widgets.md` §5 |
| OptionList as DataTable Replacement for Project List | Synthesized, 2025 | `#tui` `#widget` `#teaparty-direct` | OptionList + set_options() + prevent(OptionHighlighted) eliminates the DataTable CursorMoved async race condition in dashboard.py; Option(id=slug) removes parallel index list. | `textual-tui-selection-widgets.md` §6 |

## Python State Machine and Workflow Libraries

| Library | Year surveyed | Tags | One-line Summary | Source |
|---------|--------------|------|-----------------|--------|
| python-statemachine (fgmacedo) v3.0.0 | 2026 | `#state-machine` `#async` `#orchestration` `#teaparty-direct` | **Recommended.** Native asyncio auto-detection, fluent declarative DSL, full statecharts (compound/parallel/history states), guards, enter/exit actions. MIT, actively maintained. | `python-state-machine-libraries.md` |
| python-statemachine — Persistence and Resumption | 2026 | `#state-machine` `#orchestration` `#persistence` `#teaparty-direct` | No built-in serialization; official pattern is a persistent domain model that owns `model.state`. `start_value` param restores flat machines. Compound/history state recovery is partial — `history_values` is in-memory only and not persistable without custom code. | `python-statemachine-persistence.md` |
| transitions (pytransitions) v0.9.x | 2026 | `#state-machine` `#async` `#orchestration` | Battle-tested (6,500 stars), native AsyncMachine + HierarchicalAsyncMachine, dict-based API, MIT. Solid second choice; more ceremony than python-statemachine. | `python-state-machine-libraries.md` |
| sismic v1.6.11 | 2026 | `#state-machine` `#workflow` | Academic SCXML statechart interpreter; thread-based async incompatible with asyncio; YAML-file DSL; LGPL. Reject for asyncio-first code. | `python-state-machine-libraries.md` |
| temporalio (Temporal Python SDK) | 2026 | `#workflow` `#orchestration` | Durable async workflow execution with first-class asyncio; requires Temporal server cluster; determinism constraints; correct for distributed multi-service orchestration, overkill for in-process. | `python-state-machine-libraries.md` |
| dramatiq v2.1.0 | 2026 | `#workflow` | Distributed task queue (Redis/RabbitMQ), not a state machine. Wrong tool for in-process state management. | `python-state-machine-libraries.md` |
| prefect | 2026 | `#workflow` `#orchestration` | Data pipeline orchestration framework; requires Prefect server; designed for DAG-style batch jobs, not agent session lifecycle. | `python-state-machine-libraries.md` |
| automat (glyph) | 2026 | `#state-machine` | Twisted-era, callback-model async; no hierarchical states; MIT. Reject for asyncio projects. | `python-state-machine-libraries.md` |
| xstate-python (Stately) | 2026 | `#state-machine` | Official Python port of XState; explicitly "work in progress" as of 2026; not production-ready. | `python-state-machine-libraries.md` |
