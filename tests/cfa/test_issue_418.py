"""Issue #418: Task-level CfA states are gone; the execution phase is
flattened into a single working state.

In the five-state model (INTENT, PLAN, EXECUTE, DONE, WITHDRAWN) the
execution phase has one non-terminal state (EXECUTE) plus the two
globally terminal states (DONE, WITHDRAWN). All TASK_* states,
FAILED_TASK, COMPLETED_TASK, AWAITING_REPLIES, and the actors
execution_worker/execution_lead are removed. The probe-loop / retry
machinery in ApprovalGate (_MAX_DIALOG_TURNS, _MAX_FALLBACK_RETRIES,
_NEVER_ESCALATE_STATES, __fallback__) is deleted.

These tests encode the new invariants. Each would fail if the
corresponding removal were reverted.
